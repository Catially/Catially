### Hi there | 你好 | Grüezi | こんにちは 👋

I'm **Jin Cheng** (**程锦**) studying robotics and mechanical engineering @ETH Zürich. I love exploring new things. 

- I'm always learning new things about this world. My research focus is to make robots 🤖 behave themselves, which for now is robotic control and learning 🦾. 

- ⛰ I enjoy hiking in Switzerland. My hiking map can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1wlY6Lq-fYQDI7cXoHYGnUkJvJTV_hwOd&usp=sharing). 
- 🎞 I am a heavy film watcher. My favorite directors are Christopher Nolan and Denis Villeneuve. 
- 🎶 I listen to classical / alternative / rock music. I am also a vinyl collector. 
- 📸 I enjoy taking pictures, and some of my collections can be found [here](https://unsplash.com/@catially).
